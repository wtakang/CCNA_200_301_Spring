Create a new folder in the students folder in the class repository.
Create the folder in your clone of your fork of the repository.
Name it with your own name in CamelCase, like: CrisEwing.
In the folder create one new file, named README.md
In that new file, write up a few paragraphs about yourself.
Use proper markdown syntax.
Include at least two headings, of different levels.
Include at least one link.
Using git add, add the new folder and file to your clone of the repository.
Using git commit, commit your changes to your clone (write a good commit message). If you later edit your file, don’t forget to commit those changes too.
Using git push, push your commits to your fork on GitHub.
In GitHub’s Web UI, make a pull request to the original CodeFellows repository.
