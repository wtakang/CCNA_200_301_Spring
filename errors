Make a branch of your clone of the class repository called errors * git checkout -b errors * git push -u origin errors
Create a new file called break_me.py.

Make sure you create it in your clone of your fork of the repository.
Use git add to add the file to the repository.
In the file write four simple Python functions
Each function, when called, should cause an exception to happen
Each function should result in one of the four common exceptions from our lecture.
for review: NameError, TypeError, SyntaxError, AttributeError
Use the Python standard library reference on Built In Exceptions as a reference
Use git commit to commit changes you make to your clone
Make frequent, small commits using git commit when working.
Write clear, concise commit messages that explain what you are doing.

Finally, issue a pull request to the original CodeFellows repository with your work.
